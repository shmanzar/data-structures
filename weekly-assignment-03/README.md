### Weekly Assignment 03 | Documentation | September 17th 2020

# Instructions

In preparation for this assignment, [create a free account with Texas A&M GeoServices](https://geoservices.tamu.edu/Signup/). 

Continue work on the file you parsed in Weekly Assignment 2. If you haven't already, organize your data into a mixture of Objects and Arrays that can be [‘parsed’ and ‘stringified’](https://nodejs.org/en/knowledge/javascript-conventions/what-is-json/) as [JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON) so that it will be easier to access the data for your work on this assignment. Since you’ll be assembling a list of many results, your best bet is to first create an (empty) array and then add items to it one at a time. You can use the Array object’s [push](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push) method for this.

Write a script that makes a request to the [Texas A&M Geoservices Geocoding APIs](http://geoservices.tamu.edu/Services/Geocode/WebService/) for each address, using the address data you parsed in Weekly Assignment 2. You'll need to do some work on the address data (using code!) to prepare them for the API queries. For example, the parsed value `50 Perry Street, Ground Floor,` should be modified to `50 Perry Street, New York, NY`. The addresses are messy and may yield weird results from the API response. Don't worry too much about this right now. But, start to think about it; in a later assignment we'll have to clean these up.  

Your final output should be a `.json` **file** that contains an **array** that contains an **object** for each meeting (which may or may not nest other arrays and objects). The array should have a length equal to the number of meetings. Each object should hold the relevant data for each meeting. For now, we're focusing on the addresses and geographic coordinates. An example:  
```js
[ 
  { address: '63 Fifth Ave, New York, NY', latLong: { lat: 40.7353041, lng: -73.99413539999999 } },
  { address: '16 E 16th St, New York, NY', latLong: { lat: 40.736765, lng: -73.9919024 } },
  { address: '2 W 13th St, New York, NY', latLong: { lat: 40.7353297, lng: -73.99447889999999 } } 
]
```

Be mindful of:  
* API rate limits (you get 2,500 requests total before needing to pay TAMU for more)  
* Asyncronous JavaScript (but don't overuse `setTimeout`)  
* Keeping your API key(s) off of GitHub (use an [environment variable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) instead)  
* Keeping only the data you need from the API response, not all the data  

Update your GitHub repository with the relevant file(s). In Canvas, submit the URL of the specific location of this work within your `data-structures` GitHub repository. 

## Starter code

### Setting environment variables using npm `dotenv`

Environment variables help keep APIs secret (and off of GitHub!). There are several ways to create and manage environment variables; I recommend [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).  

Here are the steps to set this up: 

1. In the root directory of your Cloud9 workspace (e.g. `/home/ec2-user/environment`), create a new file named `.env` with the following Linux command: `touch .env`  
2. Open the new `.env` file by double clicking the file name in the Cloud 9 abstraction of the root directory structure.  
3. In this file, you may assign new environment variables. No spaces are permitted in variables assignments (unless in a text string) and each new variable assignment should be on a new line (with no blank lines in between). For example, you could create two new environment variables with:
> ```ini
> NEW_VAR="Content of NEW_VAR variable"
> MYPASSWORD="ilovemykitties"
> ```
4. **IMPORTANT: your `.env` file should NEVER, EVER end up on GitHub.** One way to manage this is by [creating a local `.gitignore` file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/ignoring-files). This file will eventually contain all your API Keys, which should be treated as carefully as you treat passwords, credit card numbers, and family secrets. Guard it with your life. 

To access, these variables, you will use `process.env` to access the environment variables created by the `dotenv` package, as demonstrated in the starter code: 

### Install dependencies
```console
npm install request async dotenv
```

### Node.js script

```javascript
"use strict"

// dependencies
const fs = require('fs'),
      querystring = require('querystring'),
      request = require('request'),
      async = require('async'),
      dotenv = require('dotenv');

// TAMU api key
dotenv.config();
const API_KEY = process.env.TAMU_KEY;
const API_URL = 'https://geoservices.tamu.edu/Services/Geocode/WebService/GeocoderWebServiceHttpNonParsed_V04_01.aspx'

// geocode addresses
let meetingsData = [];
let addresses = ["63 Fifth Ave", "16 E 16th St", "2 W 13th St"];

// eachSeries in the async module iterates over an array and operates on each item in the array in series
async.eachSeries(addresses, function(value, callback) {
    let query = {
        streetAddress: value,
        city: "New York",
        state: "NY",
        apikey: API_KEY,
        format: "json",
        version: "4.01"
    };

    // construct a querystring from the `query` object's values and append it to the api URL
    let apiRequest = API_URL + '?' + querystring.stringify(query);

    request(apiRequest, function(err, resp, body) {
        if (err){ throw err; }

        let tamuGeo = JSON.parse(body);
        console.log(tamuGeo['FeatureMatchingResultType'], apiRequest);
        meetingsData.push(tamuGeo);
    });

    // sleep for a couple seconds before making the next request
    setTimeout(callback, 2000);
}, function() {
    fs.writeFileSync('data/first.json', JSON.stringify(meetingsData));
    console.log('*** *** *** *** ***');
    console.log(`Number of meetings in this zone: ${meetingsData.length}`);
});
```
